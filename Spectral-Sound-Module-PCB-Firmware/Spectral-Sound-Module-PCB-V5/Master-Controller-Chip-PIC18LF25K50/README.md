# Master controller chip firmware

## ZIP file of latest firmware
- [Download ZIP file of version 6.0](Spectral_MasterControllerFirmwareV6.zip)

This includes release notes,  C source code and a pre-compiled binary. 

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1. You must have a 'PICKIT3' programming device or above to program the chip, with associated appropriate programming socket.
2. If compiling in MPLABX yourself then you MUST compile with a paid-for 'pro-licence' with 'full optimisation', otherwise the code is unlikely to run. This is because of critical time constraints when executing. For this reason, unless you want to develop the code further, it is recommended that you just program the chip using the pre-compiled binary file (that doesn't require the purchase of  a compiler licence).
